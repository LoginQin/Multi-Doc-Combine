##MS Word Combine script
    A perl script tool to Combine Mulit MS Word to One.(Combine many doc documents to one)
##Word合并工具
    perl版本的word合并工具
##Notes
    If u want to operate MS Word OR Excel , u need to read the VBA documnets and use the Win32::OLE module(if by Perl). This is my first time to contact VBA and OLE, I want to record the process and hope this script will help someone who wants to handle MS Office by VBA like me. Language just tools, I also write a similar Windows client in C#, but I think the most worth sharing is Perl Version.
